readline-gpl
============

This the source for the Racket package: "readline-gpl".

This package lets you use GNU's libreadline rather than libedit for the readline
collection.

This is useful if you don't have libedit on your system or if you
need features that are only in readline.

To install:

```
raco pkg install readline-gpl
```
